# cellular-automata-rule-parser

The aim of this module is to provide a way to parse common cellular automata rule format and generate a function out of it.

## Todolist

- [X] Life : 2D, outer totalistic : S/B (with MV extension)
- [X] Generations : 2D, outer totalistic with decay : S/B/C (with MV extension)
- [ ] Cyclic CA : 2D, cyclic totalistic : R/T/C/N
- [ ] Basic test cases

## Roadmap

- Implement ```NLUKY``` rules.
- Implement ```Vote for life``` rules.
- Implement Wolfram's elementary cellular automaton.
